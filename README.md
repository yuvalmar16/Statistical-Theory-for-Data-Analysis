## üß† Overview

This repository presents a series of projects developed during the **Statistical Theory for Data Analysis** course.  
Each project applies classical and Bayesian statistical methods to real-world datasets, combining rigorous hypothesis testing, regression analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning.

The goal is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical data analysis skills.

## üìÅ Files

| File | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `ProjectEX1.ipynb` | Cardiovascular disease prediction using machine learning (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC) with advanced preprocessing and feature engineering. |
| `ProjectEx2.ipynb` | Classical hypothesis testing: comparing alcohol consumption between depressed and non-depressed populations. |
| `ProjectEx3.ipynb` | Linear regression modeling: assessing how gender, alcohol consumption, and fruit intake influence BMI (Body Mass Index). |
| `ProjectEx4.ipynb` | Advanced regression diagnostics: further exploration of predictors' impact on BMI and model validation. |
| `ProjectEx5.ipynb` | Bayesian analysis: Bayesian interpretation and evaluation of the alcohol consumption/depression hypothesis. |

## üéØ Key Learning Objectives

- Conduct **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **model training** pipelines.
- Apply **hypothesis testing** (t-tests, p-value calculations) to real datasets.
- Perform **linear and multiple regression analyses** to model relationships between variables.
- Validate models via **residual analysis** and **goodness-of-fit** measures.
- Interpret **Bayesian priors and posteriors** and conduct **Bayesian inference**.

## üìå How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/Statistical-Theory-for-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Statistical-Theory-for-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

## üìà Example Topics Covered Across Projects

- Is there a significant difference in alcohol consumption between depressed and non-depressed individuals?
- What features most strongly influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases?
- How does fruit consumption or alcohol consumption impact body weight and BMI?
- How can Bayesian thinking be applied to public health data analysis?
